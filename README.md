# AsyncHttpEngineKit

A light wrapper for common http API functionality, backed by SWift Concurrency (ie sync)

The intention is to provide an agnostice workflow de-coupled from the underlying implementation.  This then allows the underlying implementation to be changed without adversly effecting the remaining code.
